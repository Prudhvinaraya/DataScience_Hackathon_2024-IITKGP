**Problem Statement:**Algorithmic Trading Model Development for BTC/USDT Crypto Market

**DOMAIN DESCRIPTION**:
Algorithmic trading in the cryptocurrency market involves deploying machine learning (ML) models and computer programs, integrating financial market expertise, data analysis,statistical modeling, and programming skills.
**Objective:**The objective is to unlock the potential of ML-based algorithmic trading, aiming to consistently generate robust returns, outperform benchmarks, and safeguard capital in the dynamic cryptocurrency market.

**Problem Description:**:The problem consists of developing algorithmic trading models for the BTC/USDT cryptocurrency market, aiming to outperform benchmark returns. 
HERE, we are required to develop algorithms that can generate returns while managing risk effectively in the specific BTC/USDT market. The problem can be divided into the following tasks:
1.Data Acquisition
2.Data Preprocessing
3. Model Design
4.Backtesting
5.Risk Management
6.Optimization

**Data:**
Data is being Collected from publicly available CoinGecko API from **2018-01-07** to **2022-01-31** which comprises of **1486 rows Ã— 5 column**s

**APPROACHES**:
1.With the help of API (CoinGecko) Data We first Tranined an LSTM Model which got an accracy of 52.4% and Sharpen ratio =1.2 which is relatively less.
2.Developed a Robust Model with same data using ARIMA models
